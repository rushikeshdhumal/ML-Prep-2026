Imagine you are a Data Analyst working at CVS Pharmacy, and you had access to pharmacy sales data. Use the IN SQL command to find data on medicines:

which were manufactured by either Roche, Bayer, or AstraZeneca
and did not sell between 55,000 and 550,000 units
Output the manufacturer name, drug name, and the # of units sold. for all the medicines which match that criteria.

Hint: don't forget about the BETWEEN operator either!

SELECT manufacturer, drug, units_sold FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE manufacturer IN ('Roche', 'Bayer', 'AstraZeneca')
AND
(units_sold NOT BETWEEN 55000 AND 550000);
